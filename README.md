- News text is very small so we can't see the Sliver AppBar animation. I repeated the news text few times to get a longer text and see the app bar animation. Check the screen recording below:

## How to run this project

1) Get your API keys from these API providers:
   - [OpenAI Completions API - ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/completions-api)
   - [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines)
2) Create a Dart file called **api_keys.dart** under **lib/core/configs/api** folder (lib/core/configs/api/api_keys.dart) 

   - Your file should look like this:
   - <img src="https://github.com/BasakK6/news_app/blob/master/readme_assets/api_keys.dart%20screenshot.png?raw=true" alt="UI screen recording" width="500"/>

3) Create 2 constant String variables named **kNewsAPIKey** and **kOpenAIKey** inside the api_keys.dart
4) Initialize your variables with your API keys
5) Run **flutter pub get** and all the errors caused by the missing file should disappear
6) Now you are ready to run the project ðŸŽ‰
